## ASCII ART OUTPUT
* ASCII-art-output is a program written in Go that takes a string as input and outputs a graphic representation of the string using ASCII characters.
* Additionally the file name of the program must be named using flag --output=<filename.txt>, where --output is the flag and <filename.txt> is the file name which will contain the output.

## Features ##
* Input Handling :-  Accepts strings containing numbers, letters, a space, special characters, and a newline character.
* ASCII Representation:- Converts the input string into a graphical representation using ASCII characters.
* Customizable Templates:- Provides different graphical templates such as "shadow," "standard," and "thinkertoy" for ASCII representation.
* Command-Line Interface-: Accessible via the command line for easy input and output.
* Error Handling:- Implements robust error handling to ensure reliable performance.
* We also included our own bannerfile i.e lean.txt
* Additionally, the program must still be able to run with a single [STRING] argument.  Example : (go run . hello) output printed should be (hello) in the specified graphical representation

## Instructions to run locally

To clone this repository, copy the command below on your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/hanapiko/ascii-art-output.git
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
cd ascii-art-output
```
## Usage
- To run the program, use the command below;
```bash
go run . [OPTION] [STRING] [BANNER]
```


## Banner Format
* Each character in the ASCII representation has a height of 8 lines.
* Characters are separated by a newline character \n.
* Incase of an empty string such as "\n" it takes a height of 1 line.

The program includes several banner formats for graphical representation using ASCII characters:

* shadow
* standard
* thinkertoy
* lean

>  The program automatically takes the banner format of `standard`, but if the user wants to use other graphical representation, the banner format desired should be the third arguement in lower case as listed above.


EX: go run . --output=<fileName.txt> something standard
